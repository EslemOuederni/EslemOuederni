### Hi, I'm Eslem ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ’»

<hr>
I'm a computer student, I had my bachelor at ISAMM univeristy and now I'm attending ESPRIT. Though, Iâ€™m currently having a gap year, where I'll be challenging myself to learn new technologies and improve myself.
<br>
My plan till the end of 2022 is to build a fullstack website using the MERN stack. After that, I'll put my focus on mobile development, using react-native mostly but also Android.
I'm a volunteer instructor with <a href='https://codefirstgirls.com/'> Code First girls</a> and a volunteer mentor with  <a href="https://frontendfoxes.school/ourschool">Front-end Foxes </a>
